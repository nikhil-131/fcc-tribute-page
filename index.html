                <p> Arunachalam Muruganantham is an Indian social entrepreneur known for his invention of a low-cost sanitary pad-making machine. Born in 1962 in Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu, India, Muruganantham's journey to creating affordable sanitary pads began when he discovered the unhygienic methods women in his community used during menstruation due to the unavailability or high cost of sanitary pads.</p>

                <p> His wife, Shanthi, also used rags during her menstruation, which prompted him to develop a solution. Muruganantham initially faced ridicule and ostracism from his community for his endeavors, as discussing menstruation was considered taboo in many parts of India. Despite this, he persevered, conducting extensive research and experimentation to develop a machine that could produce low-cost sanitary pads using locally available materials.</p>

                <p> Eventually, he succeeded in creating a simple, low-cost machine that could be operated by women in rural areas, empowering them both economically and in terms of personal hygiene. His innovation not only addressed the issue of menstrual hygiene but also created employment opportunities for women in rural areas.</p>

                <p> Muruganantham's work gained widespread recognition, and he was awarded the Padma Shri, one of India's highest civilian awards, in 2016 for his contribution to social welfare. His story has been documented in various media, including the 2018 Bollywood film "Pad Man," starring Akshay Kumar.</p>

                <p> Through his efforts, Muruganantham has helped break the silence around menstruation in India and has inspired similar initiatives globally to address menstrual hygiene and empower women.</p>
